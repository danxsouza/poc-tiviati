Hi 👋🏽!

Welcome to my poc where you navigate on the page serverest.dev with Cypress by [Danilo Batista de Souza]

## Dependencies

- Cypress v13.17.0
- Node v22.13.1
- npm v10.9.2
- git v2.46.0
- VSCode 1.96.1 (Universal)
- Or use another IDE do you prefer

## Observation
1. I recommend using the same versions, or newer versions of the systems mentioned above.
2. When installing Node.js, NPM is installed automatically.
To check the versions of git, Node.js and NPM installed on your computer, execute the git --version && node --verson && npm --version command line command on your command line terminal.
3. In the list of dependencies above, I left links to find the installers below, in case you have not installed them yet.


> Pre requirements: 
- [Node setup](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [VS Code setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)
- [Cypress IO setup](https://www.cypress.io/)



This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

On your terminal, type:

## Clone repo
1. ```sh
   https://github.com/danxsouza/poc-tiviati
   ```
## Install dependencies
3. ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
## Run the test with UI mode
2. ```sh
   npx cypress open
   ```
## Run the test 
3. ```sh
    npx cypress run
   ```
